# SkySimula
Generate (simulate) astronomical objects easily with SkySimula -- open Python3 library. The goal of the project is to provide support for generating images containing both galaxies and stellar objects, but without difficult per-photon modelling through an atmosphere or a telescope optical path. Results of the generation contain ground truth -- correct values of the parameters (e.g. FWHM, integral flux, etc) which is usefull for testing the object detection algorithms.

# Installation
<p>As of now, just unpack the repository to the folder in where your python environment stores packages.</p>
<p>For example:</p>

- Linux
<code> /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/ </code>
